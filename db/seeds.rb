# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Post.create title: "Make Ruby Great Again", body: "Only a few days before RailsConf, I was asked by Sam Phippen to fill in for his talk because he was sick and couldn't travel internationally. The only catch: I would have to speak on his topic, covering the same content, and without much in the way of ready-to-use prepared content. I stared at my white board for a few hours and agreed to do it."
